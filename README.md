# Health Care Data Analysis

This project analyzes health care data to explore the relationship between **sleep**, **step count**, and **stress levels**. It uses binning techniques and visualizations to find patterns in the data.

## 📂 Files Included

- `health_care_data_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full code and visualizations.
- `health_data.csv` – Dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Group and analyze sleep and step data.
- Visualize how different activity levels affect stress.
- Discover patterns using binning and bar plots.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📈 Sample Visualization

Bar plots were used to show how average stress levels change across different sleep and step bins, segmented by activity level.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```CMD
   git clone https:/sahebgoud1733/github.com//project.git
   cd project
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   ```CMD
   jupyter notebook health_care_data_analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Make sure `health_data.csv` is in the same folder.
